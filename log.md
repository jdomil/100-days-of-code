# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: November 18, 2020

**Past Progress**: Since a very early age I've been interested in computers and technology. One of the most pleasant memories of my early years was [the dial up internet sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDE9b5iU8vI) the weekend mornings when my father would browse the internet. 

I studied Aerospacial Engineering in college, but I barely learnt any code, apart from Programming 101, which taught me the very basics of data types, control flow, loops, and functions in C, as well as my final project, whereby I used graphical programming in [LabView](https://www.ni.com/en-ie/shop/labview.html) to build a [drone testing device](https://ibb.co/TLLH8t0). 

After finishing my degree, I moved to Cork, Ireland, where I started working in Tech Support. Soon after, in September 2017, Stripe hired me as a Support Specialist. That's when my eagerness to learn to code started. I began to enroll in online courses such as [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/), [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), and [One Month](https://onemonth.com/), this last one provided by Stripe.

After the basics were covered, I found myself in a plateau phase typical amongst new coding learners, and while I spent some of my free time watching coding videos and tried to be as close to code at work as my role would allow me, I never really committed to anything. Around the beginning of 2019 I started sourcing free online programming bootcamps and CS curriculums, coming across [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), [FreeCodeCamp]() and other MOOCs without really finishing any of them and constantly jumping between languages. 

That changed in 2020 when I decided to enroll in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) (TOP). I intermittently progressed through the "Foundations" path, until I decided to go back to college part time to study Computer Science. Despite the good results and the good memories that studying a degree brought back, I opted to drop out of it given the huge time requirement and the fact that you don't really learn to code in a CS degree - I like learning new things, but I prefer coding.

More lately, I committed to learning to code once and for all and stick to the "Full Stack Javascript" TOP curriculum, which prompted me to kick off this challenge today. Thanks to [Eoin](https://twitter.com/eoindotmurphy) and his recommendation of [The Coding Career Handbook](https://www.learninpublic.org/) I have realized how important it is to make a public committment, find a community to lean on, and **learn in public**, which is what I'll be trying to accomplish during the next 100 days.

**Thoughts:** It took me a while to decide whether I should start a blog or take on the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I eventually opted for the latter, although I haven't completely scrapped the idea of starting a blog about my atetmpt to become a self-taught developer. I know there is loads of content about this, but I have struggled to find something I can relate to - let's see if I manage to build my very own version of what I would have loved to find.

Making this is equally really scary and thrilling, and while sharing progress and code in public brings up the best of my impostor syndrome, I consider stepping out of your comfort zone as one of the best things anyone can do. That said, I would love to hear any kind of feedback, advise, or encouragement from anyone that is learning to code, already a senior developer, or not even remotely related to the tech world.

Let's do this!
