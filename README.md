# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

> JDomiL's #100DaysOfCode challenge repo.

## Disclaimer

* I took the license of forking the [original repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and tailoring it to my needs, but I still want to recognize [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away) for putting it together - I hope that's ok!
* I slightly modified the rules to adapt it to the stage at which I am. I am following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) (TOP) curriculum, and since I still need to dedicate a lot of time to study, I won't be pushing code to Github every day, but will be dedicating the same time to learning to code and log my progress.
* I have already completed the "Foundations" path in TOP, so for this challenge I'll start from the top of the "Full Stack JavaScript" path.
* If you have questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to follow me on Twitter and send me a DM: [@jDomiL](https://twitter.com/JDomiL).
* If you have any questions or ideas about 100DaysOfCode (or other ideas), feel free to reach out to ka11away on Twitter: [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away).
* If you like the [original repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and find it useful, please consider &#9733; starring it (on top right of the page) and forking it. :)

## Join the #100DaysOfCode challenge:

0.  Check out [the Official Site](http://100daysofcode.com/) for the #100DaysOfCode movement. Connect with others on the platform of your choice from this list: www.100DaysOfCode.com/connect
    Also, [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/slack) is a invite link to the 100DaysOfCode Slack channel
1.  Read [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)
2.  Fork the [original repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and commit to the [Log](log.md) or to the Alternative, rapid [R1 Log](r1-log.md) (R1 stands for Round 1) daily. [Example](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-kallaway-log).
3.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
4.  **Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!**
5.  Change the date in [Rules](rules.md) to the day you've started the challenge.
6.  Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
7.  **Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.**
8.  Follow [Alex, creator of #100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/ka11away) & [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks [@amanhimself](https://twitter.com/amanhimself) for creating it!
9.  Important: (see No.4 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
10.  If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
