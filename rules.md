# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will dedicate at least an hour every day for the next 100 days to code or learning to code.*

#### Start Date
November 18th, 2020.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code _or notes about the topic of study_ to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges _when possible, but most of the time will be dedicated to studying_. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will ~~NOT~~ _also_ count towards this challenge.
